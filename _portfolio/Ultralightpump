**Project Duration:** November 2024 - Present  
**Status:** Prototype Development

## Project Overview

Designing a portable, ultralight pump for inflating sleeping pads during backpacking trips. The goal is to create a compact solution that's lighter and more convenient than traditional manual inflation methods.

## Current Design

Working prototype utilizing a compact fan-based inflation system.
