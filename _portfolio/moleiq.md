**Company:** Robomekanics (OEM-Backed by Wild Iron)  
**Duration:** November 2025 - Present  
**Location:** Teterboro, NJ

## Project Overview

Redesigning production hardware for the MoleIQ pallet-handling robot with emphasis on manufacturability, machining constraints, and assembly sequence. Working to transition existing designs into production-ready components with proper tolerance control and clear design intent.

## Responsibilities

**Design for Manufacturing:**
* Applying DFM principles to reduce part count and simplify geometry
* Redesigning components for machining constraints and assembly sequence
* Tightening tolerance stack-ups for repeatable fabrication
* Optimizing designs for production efficiency

**CAD & Documentation:**
* Developing production-ready SolidWorks parts, assemblies, and drawings
* Maintaining clear design intent and tolerance control
* Authoring ASME Y14.5-2018 compliant drawings
* Defining datums, position/profile tolerances, and functional fits

**Production Support:**
* Managing part inventory and production components
* Supporting builds, revisions, and manufacturing release
* Coordinating with manufacturing engineers on production readiness
* Creating complete CAD packages for fabrication

## Technical Focus

**GD&T Application:**
* ASME Y14.5-2018 standards
* Datum reference frames
* Position and profile tolerancing
* Functional fit specifications

**Design Optimization:**
* Part count reduction
* Geometry simplification
* Tolerance stack-up analysis
* Assembly sequence planning

## Skills Applied

* SolidWorks (parts, assemblies, detailed drawings)
* GD&T per ASME Y14.5-2018
* Design for manufacturability (DFM)
* Tolerance analysis and stack-ups
* Production documentation
* Part inventory management
* Cross-functional collaboration
