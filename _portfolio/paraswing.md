## Project Overview

ParaSwing is a wheelchair-mounted robotic golf swing assist device developed as a senior capstone project at Rutgers University. The device was specifically designed for Eric LeGrand, a paraplegic former Rutgers football player, to enable him to perform consistent, repeatable golf swings independently.

## Key Features

* **Wheelchair-mounted design** - Direct attachment to standard wheelchair frames
* **Repeatable swing motion** - Consistent swing path for reliable golf shots
* **Robotic actuation** - Motorized assistance for controlled swing execution
* **3D-printed components** - Rapid prototyping for custom-fit parts
* **Connectivity** - Interactable through phone UI, designed for users with limited mobility who can primarily use a touchscreen.

## Technologies & Tools Used

* **SolidWorks** - Complete 3D CAD design and assembly
* **3D Printing** - Rapid prototyping of custom mechanical components
* **Mechanical Design** - Linkage design, kinematics, and structural analysis
* **GD&T** - Geometric dimensioning and tolerancing for critical interfaces
* **Fabrication** - Assembly, testing, and hardware integration

## Design Process

When we started this project, we weren't trying to reinvent adaptive sports equipment or create the next medical device breakthrough. We just wanted to build something cool that would let someone swing a golf club and have fun doing it.(within a $200 budget)

### The Goal: Just Have Fun

Not for therapy, not for professional training - just for the pure enjoyment of hitting golf balls. Sometimes, the best engineering projects are those that exist purely to bring a smile to someone's face.

### CAD Design

![CAD Assembly](/images/paraswing/cad-mockup.jpg)
*SolidWorks assembly - planned it all out before building*

We modeled everything in SolidWorks to figure out how the mechanism would work, what parts we needed, and how it would actually attach to a wheelchair without falling apart.

### Building It

![Physical Prototype](/images/paraswing/physical-prototype.jpg)
*The real deal - 3D printed parts, motors, and a lot of trial and error*

Once we had the CAD sorted out, it was time to actually build the thing:
- 3D printed most of the custom brackets and structural parts
- Lots of Zipties (the previous mounting attachment was uncomfortable.)
- Assembled everything, found out what didn't work, fixed it, repeat
- Eventually got it mounted to a wheelchair and swinging

### Testing

It hit golf balls 15 feet with the current customizable head.

## My Contributions

As the mechanical design lead on this project, I was responsible for:

- **Complete mechanical design** in SolidWorks from concept to final assembly
- **3D modeling and CAD** of all custom components
- **3D printing and fabrication** of prototype parts
- **Assembly and integration** of mechanical subsystems
- **Testing and iteration** to refine design performance
- **Design documentation** including drawings and specifications

## Technical Challenges

**Challenge 1: Wheelchair Mounting**  
Comfortable and secure mount

**Solution:** Zipties

**Challenge 2: Structural Integrity**  
Ensuring 3D-printed components could withstand repeated loading cycles without failure.

**Solution:** Optimized part geometry for additive manufacturing, selected appropriate infill densities, and reinforced high-stress areas with metal inserts( and zipties for redundancy).

**Challenge 3: User Accessibility**  
Creating controls that were easy to operate for users with limited mobility.

**Solution:** Made an app for touchscreen accessibility, allowing users with limited hand or arm movement to control the device easily through simple taps and swipes. 

## Results & Impact

Successfully designed and built a functional prototype that:

- ✅ Provides assisted, repeatable golf swing motion
- ✅ Operates safely and reliably
- ✅ Improves accessibility to recreational golf for paraplegic users
- ✅ Demonstrated successful operation during senior design presentations

This project specifically aimed to help Eric LeGrand, a former Rutgers football player who was paralyzed during a game, regain the ability to enjoy golf independently.

## Skills Demonstrated

* Advanced SolidWorks CAD modeling and assembly
* Mechanical design and kinematics
* Rapid prototyping and 3D printing
* Design for manufacturability (DFM)
* GD&T and engineering drawings
* Hardware integration and assembly
* Iterative design and testing
* User-centered design for accessibility
* Technical documentation
* Project management and teamwork

## Team & Collaboration

Senior capstone project completed as part of a multidisciplinary team, with primary responsibility for mechanical design, CAD work, prototyping, and hardware testing.

## Future Improvements(possible)

* Implement force feedback for enhanced control
* Add multiple swing profiles for different shot types
* Improve portability with folding/collapsible design
* Explore alternative actuation methods for smoother motion
* More budget for fewer Zipties

## Recognition

This project was developed as a senior capstone project at Rutgers University School of Engineering, with the goal of improving quality of life and recreational opportunities for individuals with mobility impairments.
