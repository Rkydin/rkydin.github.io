## Project Overview

ParaSwing is a wheelchair-mounted robotic golf swing assist device developed as a senior capstone project at Rutgers University. Designed for Eric LeGrand, a paraplegic former Rutgers football player, to let him swing a golf club and have fun hitting golf balls.

## The Goal

We weren't trying to reinvent adaptive sports equipment or create the next medical device breakthrough. We just wanted to build something cool that would let someone swing a golf club and have fun doing it. Within a $200 budget. Not for therapy, not for professional training - just for the pure enjoyment of hitting golf balls.

## Key Features

* **Wheelchair-mounted** - Direct attachment to standard wheelchair frames
* **Repeatable swing motion** - Consistent swing path for reliable golf shots
* **Robotic actuation** - Motorized assistance for controlled swing execution
* **3D-printed components** - Custom-fit parts made in-house
* **Phone UI control** - Touchscreen app for users with limited mobility

## Technologies Used

* **SolidWorks** - Complete 3D CAD design and assembly
* **3D Printing** - Rapid prototyping of custom mechanical components
* **Mechanical Design** - Linkage design, kinematics, and structural analysis
* **Mobile App Development** - Touchscreen interface for accessibility

## Build Process

![CAD Assembly](/images/paraswing/cad-mockup.jpg)
*Planned it all out in SolidWorks first*

We modeled everything in SolidWorks to figure out how the mechanism would work, what parts we needed, and how it would attach to a wheelchair without falling apart.

*The real deal - 3D printed parts, motors, and lots of zip ties*

Once we had the CAD sorted out:
- 3D printed most of the custom brackets and structural parts
- Lots of zip ties (the previous mounting was uncomfortable)
- Assembled everything, found out what didn't work, fixed it, repeat
- Eventually got it mounted and swinging

**Result:** It hit golf balls 15 feet with the current customizable head.

## Technical Challenges

**Challenge:** Comfortable and secure wheelchair mounting  
**Solution:** Zip ties. Lots of them.

**Challenge:** Structural integrity of 3D-printed parts  
**Solution:** Optimized part geometry, proper infill densities, metal inserts, and zip ties for redundancy.

**Challenge:** User accessibility for limited mobility  
**Solution:** Made a touchscreen app allowing easy control through simple taps and swipes.

## My Role

As mechanical design lead:
- Complete mechanical design in SolidWorks
- 3D modeling and CAD of all custom components
- 3D printing and fabrication
- Assembly and integration
- Testing and iteration
- Design documentation

## Results

✅ Provides assisted, repeatable golf swing motion  
✅ Operates safely and reliably  
✅ Improves accessibility to recreational golf  
✅ Successful senior design presentation  

Built for Eric LeGrand and anyone who just wants to hit some golf balls and have fun.

## Skills Demonstrated

* SolidWorks CAD modeling and assembly
* Rapid prototyping and 3D printing
* Mechanical design and kinematics
* Mobile app integration
* User-centered design for accessibility
* Problem-solving on a budget
* Teamwork and project management

## Future Improvements

* Multiple swing profiles for different shot types
* Folding/collapsible design for portability
* Alternative actuation methods
* More budget for fewer zip ties
