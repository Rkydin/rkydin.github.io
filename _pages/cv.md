## Portfolio Projects

### ParaSwing - Wheelchair-mounted golf swing assist device
*2024-2025*

Senior capstone project: designed and built a wheelchair-mounted robotic assist device to help users perform a repeatable golf swing. Responsible for mechanical design, CAD, prototyping, and hardware testing.

### Cable-driven gripper prototype
*2024*

Designed a cable-driven, surgical-style gripper using 3D-printed components and tendon routing. Focus on linkage design, actuation, and compact mechanical layout.

### BLDC-driven and servo-actuated Omni rc-car
*2025-Present*

In-progress robotic vehicle using BLDC motors for drive power and a servo-actuated actuation system. Currently designing motor mounts, drivetrain layout, and control architecture for directional stability and modular testing.

### Desktop face recognition tool
*2023*

Implemented a desktop face recognition application in Python using OpenCV and face recognition libraries, with a simple UI for enrolling and recognizing users from a webcam stream.
